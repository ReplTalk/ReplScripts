Notes
• The perf_stats_tab table contains both the Log Reader Agent and the Distribution Agent performance statistics that can be queried independently by using the WHERE TYPE='Distrib' clause or the WHERE TYPE='LogRead' clause. 

• The move_stats_to_tab stored procedure opens a cursor on the mslogreader_history table and on the msdistribution_history table, and then calls the move_stats_to_tab stored procedure for each row to extract the xml performance statistics data into the perf_stats_tab table.
